__Free Social Icons Reloaded add-on for Concrete5__

This Block allows you to enter your social URLs and have them displayed in a nice format with icons included. I'm talking 65 social networks to choose from with their icons (16 and 32 px format)

__Options:__

* Open the links in the same or a new page (as by many users request)
* Display Icons + Text or Icons alone
* Icons aligned right or left of the text link
* Enter your urls any way you want (with or without http://)
* "mailto:" automatically added to your email address
* Email and Rss feed fields brought to top to separate them from the "real" social networks
* CSS modified to align the icons on the text better (read included comments)
* The look and feel can be easily updated by adjusting the CSS.

This package includes over 65 icons for popular social networking websites created mostly by [Rogie](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/ "komodomedia.com") and you must abide by his [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ "komodomedia.com license"). 

The Imdb icon is by [Paul Robert Lloyd](http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2009/06/social_media_icons "Paul Robert Lloyd icons") and you must abide by his [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/ "Paul Robert Lloyd license"). I only slightly modified the 32px one to match the rest of the set.

The Instagram icon is by [Icondock](http://icondock.com/free/vector-social-media-icons "Icondock.com"). I Only resized it a bit to match the rest of the set.

The Pinterest icons are the original Pinterest website icons modified by myself to fit Rogie's icons look and feel.
